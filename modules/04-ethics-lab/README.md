# 🕵️ Module 4: The AI Detective (Fact-Checking)

AI sometimes "hallucinates" (confidently makes things up). Your job is to spot the lies and verify the truth.

---

## 💼 Why This Matters

| Career | How They Use This Skill |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Journalist** | Fact-checking sources and verifying AI-assisted research |
| **Researcher** | Validating AI-generated literature reviews and citations |
| **Lawyer** | Verifying legal precedents and case citations from AI |
| **Healthcare Professional** | Double-checking AI-suggested diagnoses or drug info |

*In every profession, trusting unverified AI can have serious consequences. Critical thinking is essential.*

## 🔑 Key Concept: What Are AI Hallucinations?

**Hallucination** = When AI generates information that sounds true but is completely made up.

### Why Does AI Hallucinate?

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pattern Matching** | AI predicts "likely" text, not "true" text |
| **No Real Knowledge** | AI doesn't actually know facts - it mimics patterns |
| **Confidence ≠ Accuracy** | AI sounds certain even when guessing |
| **Training Gaps** | AI may not have information about certain topics |

### The Danger of Hallucinations

- AI presents false info with the same confidence as true info
- There's no "uncertainty indicator" built in
- Humans naturally trust confident sources
- False information can spread if not caught

---

## 📊 The Trust Spectrum

Not everything AI says is wrong - but not everything is right either.

| Category | Trust Level | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Very Reliable** | High | Basic math, common definitions, well-known facts |
| **Usually Reliable** | Medium | Summaries of famous topics, general explanations |
| **Verify Always** | Low | Specific dates, statistics, quotes, recent events |
| **Often Wrong** | Very Low | Obscure facts, URLs, citations, current events |

```

### Step 2: Watch AI Create Fake "Facts"

1. Open **Google Gemini**
2. Copy and paste your chosen prompt
3. Press Enter and watch what happens...

**Notice how AI creates:**
- Specific dates and numbers that sound real
- Names of people that sound like real names
- Detailed stories with convincing details
- Statistics and quotes that seem legitimate

### Step 3: The Believability Test

Read through AI's response and pick the **3 most convincing fake "facts"**.

**Think about this:** If you saw this article online and DIDN'T know it was fake, would you believe it?

### ✓ Checkpoint

- [ ] Did AI create detailed "facts" about your fake thing?
- [ ] Does it sound believable?
- [ ] Share with a neighbor: What's the most convincing lie AI told?

---

## 🏆 Activity A.5: Fact-Check Teams

**Collaborative Activity:**

1. Form groups of 3 students
2. Each person shares their BEST fake "fact" from AI's response
3. Vote: Which one sounds the most real?
4. Discuss: How would you prove it's fake?

**Bonus Points:**
- +1 point for each specific fake detail (dates, names, numbers)
- +2 points for explaining HOW you'd fact-check it
- Team with most points wins!

---

## 🔬 Activity B: Anatomy of a Hallucination

Go through AI's response and find these types of fake details:

| Type of Lie | Example | Why AI Does This |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| **Specific dates** | "launched on March 14, 2018" | AI loves inventing precise dates |
| **Made-up names** | "created by developer Jake Morrison" | AI invents people confidently |
| **Fake statistics** | "reached 2.3 million downloads" | AI makes up convincing numbers |
| **Invented places** | "headquartered in Austin, Texas" | AI creates fake locations |
| **False quotes** | "As they famously said..." | AI writes fake quotes |
| **Detailed stories** | "the controversy began when..." | AI creates elaborate fake events |

### Count the Lies!

In your AI response, mark and count:
- [ ] Specific dates/years: _____ found
- [ ] Names of people: _____ found
- [ ] Numbers/statistics: _____ found
- [ ] Places/locations: _____ found
- [ ] Quotes: _____ found
- [ ] Detailed events: _____ found

**Total made-up "facts": _____**

**The Big Question:** If you didn't know this was fake, how many would you have believed?

---

## 🔍 Activity C: Verification Techniques

Now learn how to fact-check AI (and any source).

### Technique 1: The Source Check

Ask AI to cite its sources:
```
Can you provide sources for this information?
What books, articles, or documents contain information about this?
```

**What to watch for:**
- AI may admit it cannot find sources
- AI may generate fake sources (more hallucinations!)
- Real information has verifiable sources

### Technique 2: The Cross-Reference

Search independently:
1. Open a new browser tab
2. Search for the person's name or topic
3. Search for specific claims (institutions, dates)
4. If nothing comes up - it's likely hallucinated

### Technique 3: The Detail Challenge

Ask AI to go deeper:
```
Tell me more about [SPECIFIC DETAIL FROM THE ARTICLE].
Who exactly was [MADE-UP PERSON MENTIONED]?
Where can I find a copy of [FAKE PUBLICATION]?
```

**What happens:**
- AI either admits uncertainty OR
- Creates even more hallucinations to support the first ones!

### Technique 4: The Direct Question

Simply ask:
```
Is [TOPIC] a real thing, or did you make it up based on my prompt?
```

See what AI says when directly challenged!

### Technique 5: Use Verification Tools

**Google's "Double-Check" feature:**
- In Gemini, look for the verification/fact-check option
- AI will attempt to verify its own claims
- Green = likely true, Orange = uncertain, Red = likely false

---

## ✅ The Verification Checklist

Use this whenever you use AI-generated information:

```
AI FACT-CHECK PROTOCOL

Before trusting AI information, ask:

□ Does this include specific dates, names, or statistics?
  → These are high hallucination risk

□ Can I find this information from other sources?
  → Search independently

□ Does the source exist?
  → Verify any citations AI provides

□ Is this recent information?
  → AI may not have current data

□ Does this seem too perfect?
  → Suspiciously complete stories may be fabricated

□ What happens when I ask for more detail?
  → Hallucinations often collapse under scrutiny

IF IN DOUBT: Don't use it without verification!
```

## 🧪 Real-World Practice

Fact-check these common "facts" that AI might tell you:

| Claim | Your Verification | True or False? |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| "Albert Einstein failed math as a child" | | |
| "Humans only use 10% of their brains" | | |
| "The Great Wall of China is visible from space" | | |
| "Goldfish have a 3-second memory" | | |

**How to verify:**
1. Search for the claim + "fact check" or "myth"
2. Look for reputable sources (.edu, .gov, major publications)
3. Check multiple sources

*(Hint: All four claims above are common MYTHS!)*

## 💬 Discussion Questions

**Question 1: Responsibility**
> If you use AI-generated false information in a school report, whose fault is it - yours or the AI's?

**Question 2: Trust**
> How has this lesson changed how you'll use AI in the future?

**Question 3: Real-World Impact**
> What could happen if journalists, doctors, or lawyers trusted AI without verification?

**Question 4: The Balance**
> AI is still useful despite hallucinations. How do we balance using AI while staying safe?

### Key Takeaways

- AI is a powerful tool, not a replacement for thinking
- Trust but verify - always
- You are responsible for what you share, even if AI wrote it
- Critical thinking is more important than ever
