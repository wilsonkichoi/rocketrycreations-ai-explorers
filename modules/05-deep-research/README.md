## 🔑 Key Concept: What is Deep Research?

**Deep Research** = An AI mode that searches the internet, reads multiple sources, and synthesizes information into a comprehensive report.

### Regular Chat vs. Deep Research

| Regular AI Chat | Deep Research Mode |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Answers from AI's training data | Actively searches the internet |
| Quick responses (seconds) | Takes time to research (1-3 minutes) |
| Good for simple questions | Good for complex topics |
| May be outdated | Finds current information |
| Single perspective | Multiple sources synthesized |

### When to Use Deep Research

| Use Deep Research For | Use Regular Chat For |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Planning trips or events | Quick facts or definitions |
| Comparing products/options | Creative writing |
| Current events research | Code generation |
| Finding local businesses | Explaining concepts |
| Complex multi-step planning | Simple questions |

| Are the attractions real places? | | |
| Does it include practical safety info? | | |
| Are there local food recommendations? | | |

### Find the Sources

Look at the bottom of your Deep Research results:
- AI should list the websites it used
- Click on 2-3 sources to verify the information
- Do the sources actually say what AI claims?

**Record your findings:**

| Claim from AI | Source I Checked | Accurate? |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| | | Yes / No / Partially |
