## 🔑 Key Concepts

### What is Style Transfer?

Style transfer is when AI takes the **content** of one image and applies the **style** of another.

| Component | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Content** | Your pet photo, a landscape, a selfie |
| **Style** | Van Gogh's brushstrokes, pixel art, watercolor |
| **Result** | Your pet painted like "Starry Night" |

### Static vs. Motion Generation

- **Static Generation:** Creates a single, still image
- **Motion Generation:** Creates movement, animation, or video from images

## 🛠️ Tools for Today

| Tool | What It Does | Access |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **Google Whisk** | Blends subject + scene + style into new images | [labs.google.com](https://labs.google.com) |
| **Google Flow** | Creates short animated videos from images/prompts | [labs.google.com](https://labs.google.com) |
| **Google Gemini** | Generate images and get creative ideas | [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com) |

> **⚠️ Note:** Whisk and Flow require a **regular Google account** (not a child/supervised account).

## 📷 Before You Start

Prepare your materials:
- **1 Subject Image:** A photo of yourself, a pet, a toy, or any object
- **1 Style Reference (optional):** Save an image of an art style you like

**Privacy Note:** You can use any image - it doesn't have to be personal. Stock photos, drawings, or AI-generated images all work!

## 🎨 Activity A: The Style Thief (Google Whisk)

### Understanding Whisk's Three Inputs

Whisk uses three image inputs to create something new:

| Input | What It Controls | Example |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| **Subject** | WHO or WHAT is in the image | Your pet, a person, an object |
| **Scene** | WHERE the subject is placed | A forest, a city, outer space |
| **Style** | HOW it looks artistically | Anime, oil painting, neon |

### Step 1: Open Whisk

1. Go to [labs.google.com](https://labs.google.com)
2. Find and open **Whisk**
3. Sign in with your Google account

### Step 2: Add Your Inputs

**Add a Subject:**
- Click the Subject area
- Upload your prepared image OR use Whisk's suggestions

**Add a Scene (copy & paste one):**

```

```

```
futuristic city at sunset
```

```
cozy coffee shop interior
```

**Add a Style (copy & paste one):**

**Studio Ghibli Style:**
```
Studio Ghibli anime style, soft colors, hand-drawn animation look, dreamy atmosphere, detailed backgrounds, Hayao Miyazaki inspired
```

**Van Gogh Style:**
```
Vincent van Gogh painting style, bold swirling brushstrokes, thick impasto texture, vibrant yellows and blues, expressive post-impressionist art like Starry Night
```

**Retro Pixel Art:**
```
Retro pixel art style, 16-bit video game graphics, limited color palette, nostalgic 1990s arcade game look
```

**Watercolor:**
```
Soft watercolor painting style, delicate washes of color, visible paper texture, gentle color bleeding at the edges, artistic and dreamy feel
```

**Comic Book:**
```
Bold comic book style, strong black outlines, flat bright colors, action-style shading, dramatic lighting like Marvel or DC comics
```

### Step 3: Generate and Record

Click Generate and record your result:

| My Inputs | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Subject | |
| Scene | |
| Style | |
| **Result Rating (1-5)** | |
| **What I'd change** | |

## 🏆 Activity A.5: Style Battle Challenge

**Collaborative Activity:**

1. Pair up with a classmate
2. Choose a **target style** from the table below
3. Both partners try to create an image matching that style
4. Compare results - vote on whose is closer to the target
5. Discuss: What settings helped achieve the style?

| Target Style | Key Words to Look For |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Studio Ghibli | Soft colors, dreamy, hand-drawn anime |
| Van Gogh | Swirling brushstrokes, bold colors, thick texture |
| Pixel Art | Blocky, retro, limited colors |
| Watercolor | Soft, flowing, paper texture |

---

## 🔄 Activity B: The Iteration Challenge

The key to AI art isn't getting it right the first time - it's **iteration**.

### The 3-Version Challenge

Create THREE versions of the same concept, changing ONE element each time:

**Version 1: Original**
- Keep your first result as a baseline

**Version 2: Style Swap**
- Same subject and scene
- Different style (e.g., change from "anime" to "oil painting")
- Compare: How did the mood change?

**Version 3: Scene Shift**
- Same subject and style
- Different scene (e.g., change from "forest" to "underwater")
- Compare: How did the story change?

### Reflection Questions

- Which version do you like best? Why?
- What surprised you about how AI interpreted your inputs?
- What would you try next?

## 🎬 Activity C: Bring It to Life (Google Flow)

Now let's add motion to your images!

### Step 1: Open Google Flow

1. Navigate to Flow in [Google Labs](https://labs.google.com)
2. If Flow isn't available, you can use Gemini with video prompts

### Step 2: Choose Your Starting Point

**Option A: Animate Your Whisk Creation**
1. Download your favorite Whisk image
2. Upload it to Flow
3. Add a motion prompt from the examples below

**Option B: Start Fresh in Flow**
1. Type a scene description with motion
2. Generate the animation

### Step 3: Animation Prompts (Copy & Paste)

**Walking Cat Under Starry Night:**
```
A cute orange cat walking slowly across a field at night, Van Gogh Starry Night style with swirling blue sky and glowing yellow stars, the cat moves from left to right, gentle wind blowing through the grass
```

**Studio Ghibli Forest Scene:**
```
A magical forest with glowing fireflies floating upward, Studio Ghibli anime style, soft camera pan through the trees, gentle breeze making leaves sway, dreamy atmosphere
```

**Pixel Art Adventure:**
```
A pixel art knight character walking through a castle hallway, retro 16-bit video game style, torches flickering on the walls, character walks forward toward the camera
```

**Underwater Scene:**
```
Colorful tropical fish swimming in a coral reef, watercolor painting style, fish slowly drifting left to right, sunbeams filtering through the water, bubbles rising up
```

### Motion Keywords Reference

| Add This | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| "walking left to right" | Character moves across screen |
| "slow zoom in" | Camera gets closer |
| "pan left to right" | Camera slides sideways |
| "gentle breeze" | Subtle movement in hair/leaves/grass |
| "floating upward" | Objects drift up (bubbles, fireflies) |
| "flickering" | Light sources pulse |
| "loop seamlessly" | Animation repeats smoothly |

## 🖼️ Gallery Walk (If in a group)

1. Select your best creation (Whisk image or Flow animation)
2. Display on your screen
3. Walk around and view 3-4 classmates' work
4. For each piece, note:
   - One thing you like about it
   - One question you have (how did they achieve that effect?)
